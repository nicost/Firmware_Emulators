# Firmmware Emulators

This repository contains firmware code to emulate existing (microscope) equipment.  This firmware can be loaded on readally available, low cost devices, enabling testing of code that interfaces with the (microscope) equipment.  Do not rely on the behavior of these emulators (they will never behave exactly as the real thing), but they may be easy to have when access to the real equipment is limited.
